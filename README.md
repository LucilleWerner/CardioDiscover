#### About
 This application will enable researchers to automatically discover
 target genes from multi-phenotype summary GWAS datasets, for future
 assays. The code is specifically developed for cardiovascular
 phenotypes, but will be largely applicable to other types of GWAS.

#### Structure
The application consists of several modules:
* GWAS parser
* RNAseq parser
* SNP conformer
* Statistical tester
* Gene mapper
* Drugability tester
* SNP ranker
